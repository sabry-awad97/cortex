# Cortex: A Brainfuck Interpreter

Cortex is a robust and efficient Brainfuck interpreter implemented in Rust. This project demonstrates advanced programming concepts and showcases the power and flexibility of the Rust programming language.

## Features

- Full support for the Brainfuck programming language
- Efficient memory management
- Comprehensive error handling
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Installation

To install Cortex, make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. Then, clone this repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cortex.git
cd cortex
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

To run a Brainfuck program using Cortex, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run -- path/to/your/brainfuck/file.bf
```

For example:

```bash
cargo run -- examples/hello.bf
```

## Examples

We've included several example Brainfuck programs in the `examples/` directory:

- `hello.bf`: Prints "Hello, World!"
- `add.bf`: Adds two numbers
- `fibonacci.bf`: Generates Fibonacci sequence

Feel free to use these examples to test Cortex or as a starting point for your own Brainfuck programs.

## About Brainfuck

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. It consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. Despite its minimalism, it's Turing-complete.

### Basic Concepts

1. **Memory Model**

   - The program operates on an array of 30,000 byte cells, initialized to zero.
   - There's a pointer that starts at the first cell and can move left or right.

2. **Commands**

   - `>` : Move the pointer to the right
   - `<` : Move the pointer to the left
   - `+` : Increment the current cell by 1
   - `-` : Decrement the current cell by 1
   - `.` : Output the ASCII character of the current cell
   - `,` : Input a character and store its ASCII value in the current cell
   - `[` : If the current cell is zero, jump to the matching `]`
   - `]` : If the current cell is nonzero, jump back to the matching `[`

3. **Program Structure**

   - A Brainfuck program is a sequence of these commands.
   - Any character that's not one of the eight commands is ignored (can be used for comments).

4. **Loops**
   - Loops are denoted by `[` and `]`.
   - They continue as long as the current cell is non-zero.

### Example Breakdown

Let's analyze a simple Brainfuck program that outputs "Hi":

```brainfuck
++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.
```

Breaking it down step by step:

1. `++++++++`

   - Add 8 to cell #0

2. `[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]`

   - This is the main loop that sets up the memory cells
   - It runs 8 times (the value we set in cell #0)
   - Inside this loop, we set up the ASCII values for 'H' (72) and 'i' (105)

3. `>>.`

   - Move the pointer to cell #2 and output it (ASCII 72, 'H')

4. `>---.`

   - Move to cell #3, subtract 3, and output it (ASCII 105, 'i')

5. `+++++++..+++.`

   - Add 7 to cell #3, output twice (ASCII 108, 'l')
   - Add 3 and output again (ASCII 111, 'o')

6. `>>.`

   - Move to cell #5 and output (ASCII 32, space)

7. `<-.`

   - Move back to cell #4, subtract 1, and output (ASCII 87, 'W')

8. `<.`

   - Move to cell #3 and output (ASCII 111, 'o')

9. `+++.------.--------.`

   - Modify and output cell #3 three more times:
     - Add 3 (ASCII 114, 'r')
     - Subtract 6 (ASCII 108, 'l')
     - Subtract 8 (ASCII 100, 'd')

10. `>>+.`
    - Move to cell #5, add 1, and output (ASCII 33, '!')

This program efficiently sets up the memory cells with the ASCII values for "Hello World!" and then outputs them character by character.
